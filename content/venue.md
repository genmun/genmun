    - **Nearest station:** Kajang
    - **Line Frequency:** 10 minutes

</div>

Once you arrive at Kajang MRT station or UKM Komuter station, we highly recommend taking e-hailing service to our center since it is considerably faster and less hassle. However, if you wish, you can take one of the feeder buses listed below to Tun Seri Lanang Library and walk to our center from there.

<div class="cards venue2">

- T451 MRT feeder bus
    - available at Kajang MRT station 
    - **Freqeuncy:** 30 minutes - 1 hour 
    - **Price:** MYR 3.00 (only accepts Touch N Go card payment method)

- UKM Kiffah bus Zone 6 
    - available at UKM Komuter station 
    - **Frequency:** 30 minutes to 1 hour 
    - **Price:** free

</div>

The walk from Tun Seri Lanang Library to our center is 2km long and should take around half an hour. Be warned that the walk consists of mostly jungle terrain and is a bit dangerous. Once again, we do not recommend this method of travelling to those that are unfamiliar with our university campus. 


### International Arrival

We recommend flying into Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). There, you can go to our center by taking KLIA Transit or KLIA Express to KL Sentral, the largest railway station in Malaysia, and use the transportation methods listed in the above section (MRT or Komuter). Airport transfer is also available from KLIA to our center, albeit at a higher cost.
