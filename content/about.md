The Model United Nations, usually known as MUN, is a simulation of actual United Nations conferences. Participants are known as delegates, and are each assigned a country to represent as well as a council or committee to participate in. Throughout the conference period, delegates will have to discuss a given topic and reach a resolution with the rest of their council members by the end.
