<p>The path we took to get to this point is not one that is direct but rather one with many peaks and valleys and we are proud to be climbing one of our steepest peaks, the GENIUS Model United Nations Conference 2023, fueled by the hope of the best view there is yet to see. </p><br>
<p>This long-winded journey had to start with a single step and that step was made in 2014 by a group of passionate diplomats from Kolej GENIUS@Pintar Negara, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (previously known as Kolej PERMATApintar Negara) and it was this very group who pioneered the long total commitment to diplomacy and policy-making by sending a group delegation, led by, Miss Rahazimah Al Zahrah binti Abu Bakar Sadiqin to the Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit in Singapore which was officiated by, S.R. Nathan, the former president of Singapore. A great advisor is the backbone of a great delegation and that advisor is Madam Siti Noor Diana Mohd Kamaruddin who is still advising us to this day. </p><br>
<p>After the seniors graduated in 2015, the juniors paved in their footsteps and also sent a group delegation to the Dunman High Model ASEAN Plus Summit in Singapore. The juniors kept on building from the efforts of their seniors and made our school proud by bringing home many awards and establishing diplomatic relations from the many conferences they joined. </p>

</div>
<p>Fast forward a few years and many conferences later, it was 2018 and we were more motivated, experienced, and well-connected than ever. It was high time to climb our next peak, which was the 2018 PERMATA Model United Nations (PERMUN) conference. This conference was a great success thanks to the extremely driven Secretariat team behind it and of course, the support of all the wonderful delegates that took part in the conference. </p><br>
<p>Just as we were standing on this peak we were met with our first deep valley, the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent us all into lockdown and prevented us from being able to join or host physical conferences. This was a colossal halt to our uphill momentum but we still tried to make the most out of it by joining many online conferences. The lack of physical conferences made it hard to attract new junior delegates and it was also difficult to train them which unfortunately sent us downhill for a while. </p><br>
<p>At the end of 2021, things were starting to return to normal but we knew we had a lot of rebuilding to do before hosting our own conference again. We started to train new junior delegates and scouted for conferences we can participate in to establish more diplomatic relations. This was the start of our uphill journey toward our next peak.</p><br>
<p>Moving into 2022, we have well-trained delegates eager to join many conferences and hence that is exactly what we did. Organizing our own conference was always in the back of our minds and sticking with that goal we started to network and build connections as well as collaborate with organizations such as the Malaysian Youth Association for Diplomacy and Policy (MYADP). Towards the end of the year, a lot of background work for the GMUN 2023 conference already started and the Secretariat team was feeling more motivated than ever.</p>

</div>
<p>This year in 2023, we had the amazing opportunity to fly to The Hague, Netherlands to participate in the Haganum Model United Nations (HagaMUN) conference as well as to further build our name in the international MUN scene. After gathering tons of experience as well as connections, we are now more ready than ever to organize our own conference, and with that, we are proud and honored to announce that the GENIUS Model United Nations (GMUN) Conference will be held from July 7th till July 9th, 2023.</p>
