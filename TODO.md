### Fonts & Language
- [x] Fonts used for texts are hard to read and unappealing to the eye.
- [x] The line spacing is too small, making it harder to read. Explore small fonts with big line spacing. Ensure that when highlighted, the line spacing doesn't overlap each other.
- [ ] Use concise language, simple and straightforward yet effective.
- [x] The 'P' in 'GENIUS@Pintar' is capitalized.

### Logo
- [x] We have a new logo, so might need to change the old logo.
