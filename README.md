# GENIUS Model United Nations 2023 Website

This repository contains source code for the official website of GENIUS Model United Nations 2023, [https://gmun.my](https://gmun.my), which is held from 7th to 9th July 2023 by Pusat GENIUS@Pintar Negara UKM. 

## Setting up Development Environment

### Pure HTML

This website is developed with pure HTML language with little to no other tools.

### Tailwind CSS

The code heavily utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), although I made up some CSS classes that suits the website. 

### PHP Header and Footer

Initially, the code utilizes PHP language to sync headers and footers across all pages. But after the development of headers and footers are done, I use Find and Replace to make changes to the headers and footers.

### Backend

The website is hosted with the free version of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). No other backend tools or database are used.

### Development Branch

The repository has two branches, the **Beta** (development) branch and the **Online** (production). All changes to the website are pushed to the [Beta site](https://beta--gmun.netlify.app/) first before being released to the public in the **Online** branch.
